In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when using nested routes and the `useParams` hook.  If you have a route like `/users/:userId/profile`, and you try to access `params.userId` before the component mounts or if the route is not matched, you will encounter a runtime error because `params` will be undefined.  This often happens when fetching data based on the `userId` within the `useEffect` hook without proper checks.
